                    I have a year of experience even though I am a new graduate, because I worked in the field of
                    programming while I was in my last year at the university, where I created an application on the
                    flutter for a client, and I was also an assistant coach where I supervised projects for trainee
                    students. I also did many projects during my studies at the university and learned many programming
                    languages because of my hobby in programming. I have a saying that I always say "I don't say I don't
                    know this thing and it's over! On the contrary, I say I will learn it, because there is no person
                    who has sealed knowledge and lack of knowledge is not a shame as much as your unwillingness to
                    learn." I believe that pressure is what shows the real capabilities of the programmer, especially if
                    he enjoys programming!.

                    I want to apply for the program because I want to learn React to develop my programming skills, and
                    so that I can apply to companies.
                    Many companies, whether in Palestine or abroad, use React for their large projects, so I am
                    interested in learning it.
                    I am a quick learner and an independent learner, so I am sure that with my skills and the guidance
                    of a professional trainer, I will master React in a short time.
